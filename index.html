        <div class="ul">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">1928</span> - Maya Angelou (born April 4, 1928,
              St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.—died May 28, 2014, Winston-Salem, North
              Carolina) American poet, memoirist, and actress whose several
              volumes of autobiography explore the themes of economic, racial,
              and sexual oppression.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span class="bold">1928</span> - Although born in St. Louis,
              Angelou spent much of her childhood in the care of her paternal
              grandmother in rural Stamps, Arkansas. When she was not yet eight
              years old, she was raped by her mother’s boyfriend and told of it,
              after which he was murdered; the traumatic sequence of events left
              her almost completely mute for several years.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span class="bold">1940</span> - In 1940 Angelou moved with her
              mother to San Francisco and worked intermittently as a cocktail
              waitress, a prostitute and madam, a cook, and a dancer. It was as
              a dancer that she assumed her professional name.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span class="bold">1950</span> - Moving to New York City in the
              late 1950s, Angelou found encouragement for her literary talents
              at the Harlem Writers’ Guild. About the same time, Angelou landed
              a featured role in a State Department-sponsored production of
              George Gershwin’s folk opera Porgy and Bess; with this troupe she
              toured 22 countries in Europe and Africa.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span class="bold">1961</span> - She also studied dance with
              Martha Graham and Pearl Primus. In 1961 she performed in Jean
              Genet’s play The Blacks. That same year she was persuaded by a
              South African dissident to whom she was briefly married to move to
              Cairo, where she worked for the Arab Observer. She later moved to
              Ghana and worked on The African Review.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span class="bold">1966</span> - Angelou returned to California in
              1966 and wrote Black, Blues, Black (aired 1968), a 10-part
              television series about the role of African culture in American
              life. As the writer of the movie drama Georgia, Georgia (1972),
              she became one of the first African American women to have a
              screenplay produced as a feature film. She also acted in such
              movies as Poetic Justice (1993) and How to Make an American Quilt
              (1995) and appeared in several television productions, including
              the miniseries Roots (1977).
            </li>

            <li>
              <span class="bold">1969</span> - Her early life is the focus of
              her first autobiographical work, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings
              (1969; TV movie 1979), which gained critical acclaim and a
              National Book Award nomination. Subsequent volumes of
              autobiography include Gather Together in My Name (1974), Singin’
              and Swingin’ and Gettin’ Merry Like Christmas (1976), The Heart of
              a Woman (1981), All God’s Children Need Traveling Shoes (1986), A
              Song Flung Up to Heaven (2002), and Mom & Me & Mom (2013)
            </li>

            <li>
              <span class="bold">1973</span> - Angelou received a Tony Award
              nomination for her performance in Look Away (1973), despite the
              fact that the play closed on Broadway after only one performance.
              In 1998 she made her directorial debut with Down in the Delta
              (1998). The documentary Maya Angelou and Still I Rise (2016)
              depicts her life through interviews with Angelou and her intimates
              and admirers.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span class="bold">1981</span> - In 1981 Angelou, who was often
              referred to as “Dr. Angelou” despite her lack of a college
              education, became a professor of American studies at Wake Forest
              University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Among numerous honours
              was her invitation to compose and deliver a poem, “On the Pulse of
              Morning,” for the inauguration of U.S. Pres. Bill Clinton in 1993.
              She celebrated the 50th anniversary of the United Nations in the
              poem “A Brave and Startling Truth” (1995) and elegized Nelson
              Mandela in the poem “His Day Is Done” (2013), which was
              commissioned by the U.S. State Department and released in the wake
              of the South African leader’s death. In 2011 Angelou was awarded
              the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
